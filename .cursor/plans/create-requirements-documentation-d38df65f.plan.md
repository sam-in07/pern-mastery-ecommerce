# Create Requirements Documentation

I will create a `requirements` directory and populate it with a markdown file for each page in the application. Each file will contain the requirements in User Story format, based on the existing implementation.

## Steps

1.  Create the `requirements` directory.
2.  Create `requirements/home_page.md` with user stories for the Home Page.
3.  Create `requirements/login_page.md` with user stories for the Login Page.
4.  Create `requirements/signup_page.md` with user stories for the Signup Page.
5.  Create `requirements/product_details_page.md` with user stories for the Product Details Page.
6.  Create `requirements/shopping_cart_page.md` with user stories for the Shopping Cart Page.
7.  Create `requirements/checkout_page.md` with user stories for the Checkout Page.
8.  Create `requirements/category_page.md` with user stories for the Category Page (Electronics).
9.  Create `requirements/search_results_page.md` with user stories for the Search Results Page.

## User Story Format

Each file will follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Page Name] Requirements

## User Stories

- As a [user role], I want to [action], so that [benefit].
- ...
