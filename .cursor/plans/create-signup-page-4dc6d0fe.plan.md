# Create Signup Page

I will create a new `signup.html` page that mirrors the design of the existing `login.html` but is tailored for user registration.

## User Interface

- **Layout**: Identical to `login.html` (Header, Footer, Clean centered card layout).
- **Form Fields**:
- First Name (New)
- Last Name (New)
- Email Address (Existing)
- Password (Existing, with show/hide toggle)
- **Actions**:
- Primary Button: "Create Account"
- Secondary Link: "Already have an account? Sign In"

## Implementation Steps

1.  Create `signup.html` by copying the content of `login.html`.
2.  Update the `<title>` and page heading.
3.  Modify the form to include "First Name" and "Last Name" inputs.
4.  Update the submit button text to "Create Account".
5.  Change the bottom "Create an account" section to link back to `login.html` ("Sign In").
6.  Ensure all links (logo, nav) point to correct pages.

### To-dos
