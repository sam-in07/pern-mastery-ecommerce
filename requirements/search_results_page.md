# Search Results Page Requirements

## User Stories

### Navigation & Context
- As a user, I want to see breadcrumbs to navigate back to Home.
- As a user, I want to see a clear heading stating "Results for [My Query]" so I know what is being shown.

### Filtering & Sorting
- As a user, I want to sort the search results by relevance, price, or rating.
- As a user, I want to verify the number of results found.
- As a user, I want to access filters similar to the category page to narrow down my search.

### Product Listing
- As a user, I want to view the search results in a grid layout.
- As a user, I want each result to display the product image, price, title, and rating.
- As a user, I want to see special badges (e.g., "Clearance", "Rollback") on search results.
- As a user, I want to be able to add items to the cart from the search results.

### Pagination
